# Universal_tester_c
A small code which makes testing single file C programs easier, faster and more readable too!

## Usage:
Insert the file into the folder containing your files, then launch it with     

    ./tester
    or
    tester
    
inside your terminal.

You'll get prompted with a list of files, choose yours and the code will automatically compile and launch your file
